# Server Client Bots

# Curl
Curl 8.11.0 for 64-bit on windows was downloaded [here](https://curl.se/windows/) <br />
Curl for macos was brewed `brew install curl`

# Server
The server uses javascript, nodejs and expressjs. 

# Clients
I made two clients, one for windows and one for macos.

# Note
For curl on windows you will need to put the path of curl/bin to user environment paths.
