# Dragon soul bots

# Curl
Curl's source code was cloned from github with `git clone https://github.com/curl/curl.git`

# Server
The server uses javascript, nodejs and expressjs. 

# Clients
I made two clients, one for windows and one for macos. The support bot, which is on windows, reduces wait time for ape transformation for the primary bot on macos. The support bot also joins the primary bot on raids for better drop rates and more raid crystals. These bots are made in c and they use libcurl to talk to the server.
